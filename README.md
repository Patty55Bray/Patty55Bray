## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub repository! I am a data engineer with extensive experience in building large-scale data pipelines using cutting-edge technologies like Hadoop, Spark, and Kafka. My work focuses on designing and implementing robust systems that can efficiently process and analyze real-time data at scale, helping organizations turn raw data into actionable insights.

With a deep understanding of distributed computing, I leverage Hadoop's ecosystem to store and manage vast amounts of structured and unstructured data across clusters. I work with HDFS to ensure efficient storage and processing of big data, while utilizing MapReduce and YARN for task scheduling and resource management. Additionally, I design data workflows that optimize performance and handle data at scale, ensuring reliability and fault tolerance throughout the system.

Apache Spark is a key tool in my toolkit for real-time data processing. By utilizing its in-memory processing capabilities, I build high-speed, scalable data processing pipelines that can handle large volumes of data with low latency. Whether itâ€™s stream processing with Spark Streaming or batch processing with Spark SQL, I focus on optimizing performance to meet the needs of modern data-driven applications.

Kafka plays a central role in enabling real-time data ingestion and messaging. I design systems that rely on Kafkaâ€™s distributed streaming platform to ingest, process, and transmit real-time data across multiple services. This ensures that data flows seamlessly across the entire pipeline, enabling real-time analytics and decision-making.

This repository contains several of the data engineering projects I have worked on, including code samples, pipeline designs, and optimizations. I hope these resources provide insight and inspiration for other data engineers working with similar technologies. Feel free to explore, contribute, or reach out if you have any questions or feedback!
